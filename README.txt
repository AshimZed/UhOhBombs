# Uh Oh Bombs !

## About the game:

Uh Oh Bombs ! is a **very** simple command line game where the player moves around a 2D grid and is meant to avoid bombs by using the **Radiation Sensor** output as guidance.

## Why was this made?

This project represents one of my early coding endeavors. I developed it in an afternoon, focusing on practicing modular Python programming while grappling with the basics. 
The code contains hints of features that may be developed in the future, like a flagging mechanism reminiscent of Minesweeper.

### How to Install and Play:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory using the terminal
3. Run `py main.py` to start the game

### Gameplay Instructions:

- Input 'w', 'a', 's', or 'd' to move in a direction
- Pay attention to the **Radiation Sensor's** readings to avoid the bombs
- The objective is to reach the edge of the grid without stepping on a bomb
